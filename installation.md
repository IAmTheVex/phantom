# Installation steps

There are many methods to install the SDK. The recommended one is using the `Check out project from Version Control` option in Android Studio. Alternatively you can use git to clone the repo `git clone --depth=1 git@bitbucket.org:phantomrobotics/kit.git`, or download it direclty as a zip from [here](https://bitbucket.org/phantomrobotics/kit/downloads/), extract it and import it.

Before you install the SDK make sure your Android Studio version supports Kotlin out of the box or install the Kotlin plugin for Intellij IDEA/Android Studio.

## Check out project from Version Control

Is a good practice to use VCS because you can easily upgrade your local SDK if a new version is published. The new versions will NOT bring breaking changes. The VCS is also a nice tool for collaborative coding (features like branching).

When you open up Android Studio, one of the options is to check out a project from Version Control. Click on that.

You will be prompted to choose what type of VCS you have. Phantom is using Git (and so does a huge number of people), so click on the Git option.

In the next popup you need to choose the directory where you want the project to be stored and also where to clone it from. The url is `git@bitbucket.org:phantomrobotics/kit.git`. You can also click the test button to check if it's working. After that you may hit the clone button.

Now wait for the clone procedure to finish.

After the clone procedure is finished you will be surprised with a nice dialog that asks you if you would like to import the cloned project. Click yes.

Now you can follow the import procedure described [here](https://iamthevex.github.io/phantom/import) or just follow your intuition and click on next until you can click on finish ðŸ˜„
